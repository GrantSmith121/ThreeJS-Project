# ThreeJS Project

This project was created to create a prototype for a specific concept I had. I wanted to use the power of normal maps to give a site a patterned background that has dynamic lighting.

To achieve this, I used ThreeJS, a 3D JavaScript library that allows developers to insert 3D meshes with unique materials. Most often, it is used to create elements on a site that rotate, morph or otherwise provide
a number of impressive effects. In this project, I used it to create a background for a site. The light source follows the mouse so that the light always appears to be coming in from an angle based on the mouse position. This creates a unique, interactive effect. This project serves as an excercise in web development as well as a prototype of this concept. This could be used in a number of different ways to create an attention-grabbing effect for a user.
