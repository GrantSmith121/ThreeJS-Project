# ThreeJS Dynamic Background

This project was created to create a prototype for a specific concept I had. I wanted to use the power of normal maps to give a site a patterned background that has dynamic lighting. The goal was to use this technology to create a unique, attention-grabbing effect for a web site.

## Introduction

The project showcases the power of ThreeJS, a versatile 3D JavaScript library commonly used to integrate 3D elements into web applications. Although it is most commonly used to create 3D effects that are more "obviously" 3D, I used it here to create a background. Backgrounds are usually flat, but, using normal maps, I am able to create something a bit more dynamic and interesting.

## Features

__1. Dynamic lighting:__ The background utilizes normal maps to simulate dynamic lighting effects, creating the illusion of depth.

__2. Interactivity:__ The light source for the background follows the mouse. This creates a level of interactivity with the user and emphasizes wherever the user decides to take the mouse.

__3. Tools__: For this demonstration, the user can alter different apsects of the background. They can choose a different background, increase/decrease the strength of the 3D effect and choose the color of the light source.

## Applications

* __User Engagement__: Enhance user experience by providing visually captivating backgrounds that respond to user interaction.
* __Storytelling__: Use dynamic backgrounds to convey narratives or themes, adding depth and immersion to content.
